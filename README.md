# Databricks Code Practice

### Get fluent in Databricks by typing, not watching.

**149 exercises, 4 production-grade pipeline labs, and 2 deep-dives. All on Databricks Free Edition.**

Clone once, import into Databricks, pick a folder. Exercises fail loud until your code is right; labs ship with synthetic data so you build production-style pipelines, not toy ones.

> **Prepping for interviews?** Writing code is one half of the battle - knowing the questions that actually come up is the other. I maintain [Databricks Interview Cheat Sheets](https://dataengineer.wiki/products?utm_source=github&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=databricks-code-practice) by seniority level (junior / mid / senior / bundle).

## What's Inside

Fluency comes from reps, not reading. Three structured paths:

- **`exercises/`** - focused reps on a single concept. LeetCode-style, 5-30 min each.
- **`pipeline-labs/`** - end-to-end medallion pipelines on a business scenario. 2-3 hours each.
- **`deep-dives/`** - go deep on a single topic, hands-on, end to end. 1-3 hours each.

## Which Should I Start With?

- **New to Databricks?** Start with [DE Associate Cert Prep](pipeline-labs/de-associate-cert-prep/) - broadest fundamentals.
- **Want quick reps on a specific concept?** [Delta Lake exercises](exercises/delta-lake/), [ELT exercises](exercises/elt/), or [Streaming exercises](exercises/streaming/) - drill one concept at a time.
- **Comfortable with batch, new to streaming?** Start with [Streaming exercises](exercises/streaming/) for atomic concept drills, then [Apparel DLT](pipeline-labs/apparel-streaming/) and [Fintech Monitoring](pipeline-labs/fintech-monitoring/) for end-to-end pipelines.
- **Preparing for a cert?** [DE Associate](pipeline-labs/de-associate-cert-prep/) or [Spark Developer Associate](pipeline-labs/pyspark-cert-zenith/).
- **Already shipping pipelines, want to go deeper on performance?** [Delta Optimization Techniques](deep-dives/optimization-techniques/).
- **Want to ship natural-language analytics (Genie / AI/BI)?** [Build a Genie Space](deep-dives/genie-sales-analytics/) - connect Genie to a star schema, benchmark its accuracy, embed it in a dashboard.

## Feedback

Found an exercise that can't be solved as written? That's the most useful thing you can report - [open an issue](../../issues/new/choose). Suggestions for new topics welcome too.

Finished an exercise and want to keep your work? Fork the repo - your solutions stay in your fork. Please don't open a PR with solved TODO cells; it deletes the exercise for everyone else. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## License

[CC BY-SA 4.0](LICENSE). In plain terms:

- **Use it, fork it, adapt it, teach from it** - at work, in a study group, on your blog, in a bootcamp, in paid training. Commercial use is fine.
- **Credit it clearly.** Name this repo and link back, visibly enough that your audience knows where the exercises came from. Passing them off as your own material is the one thing that isn't allowed.
- **Share adaptations under the same terms.** If you modify the exercises, your version carries this license too - so nobody can take a fork private and lock it down.

Using this in paid training or a course? Go ahead - just keep the attribution obvious. I'd genuinely like to hear about it: [say hi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jrlasak/).
